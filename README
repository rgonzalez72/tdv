Time Doctor Visualizer

A tool to visualize linux timedoctor files. This tool is written in Python and uses wxPython and matplolib for the UI and graphics.

You must install python and the libraries: matplotlib, numpy and wxPython before you can use the program. The main file tdgui.py. 

I managed to run the program in Windows, Linux and MAC.
